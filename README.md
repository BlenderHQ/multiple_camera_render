Add-on for **Blender 2.80+** with which you can render sequentially all or only selected cameras in scene.
Addon was made to help in prototyping **photogrammetry, photometry or volumetric capture Multi Camera Rigs**.
You can quickly simulate not only camera layout choose suitable lenses, and simulate real cameras and lenses imperfections. Like lens distortions, DOF and aberrations.
Quickly render with **Eevee** or **Cycles** and test this renders as a synthetic dataset in your favourite **photogrammetry software**.

Addon itself is not limited to use only for photogrammetry and prototyping. Any scenes that can required render stills from different cams is a good case for it.
For example addon would be good for rendering proxy [impostors](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/Engine/Content/Tools/RenderToTextureTools/3/index.html) for Unity / Unreal. 

#### Usage
